We found many of their shells within our planets, crashed there thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of years before our arrival, but some of their outfits survived long enough for us to reverse engineer these advanced technologies."`

			`	Taely starts browsing through a bunch of images on her console. In a few minutes, she appears to have selected half a dozen different events. "Look at these, <first>. What do you see?" The first image shows one of the Fetri'sei working on some kind of small structure. In the following pictures, presumably depicting different Fetri'sei, the structure becomes gradually bigger and more complex until the last one, where a Ka'het-like slug is shown growing inside this shell. "They are Von Neumann probes," she says. "Self replicating spacecraft. Unlike the Ka'het, which we found to be unable to reproduce and can only be created in a factory, these Ka'sei can duplicate their own structure with the material harvested from the local asteroids. The process probably takes years, or more, but it's still an incredible achievement."`

The Ka'het can survive for a few hundred years once they become operational; these could be potentially last for a much shorter time given their structure. Another important factor is that we don't know what happened here in the millennia the system was hidden, perhaps the Ka'sei went into hibernation waiting for the system to appear again."`

"Well, consider that the Ka'het are true battleships, heavily shielded and always with their weapons ready. These are more akin to reconnaissance and mining probes. Their structure is extremely weak, and they don't have any weapons except the guns necessary to mine asteroids. I imagine it would take decades even for just a Maeri'het to replicate itself.`

Limited to sub-light velocity, they'd need hundreds of years to pass from one system to another, which testifies how patient the Builders could be. Most species we have encountered abandon any form of sub-light transportation method between star systems as soon as hyperdrives start being developed. For all we know, the Ember Waste could have been visited by these Ka'sei, but they had to leave for some reason we aren't aware of. The last Builder died almost 100,000 years ago, so long that having a clear idea of what happened is impossible."`

"This image shows the route followed by every Ka'sei the scanner was able to track. At first sight they don't seem to have much in common, right? However, upon closer examination, there is something that almost every path has in common: a single asteroid, one of the biggest in the entire asteroid belt and that once in a while every ship spends a few minutes on.`
			`	"However, this could easily have been just a coincidence: asteroids of that size need a lot of effort before being able to extract anything useful so maybe they were just combining their forces to get its minerals. Unusual, but far from impossible. So, at this point I had an idea." The screen on the touchpad changes, now showing raw numbers separated on a spreadsheet. "The sensors you carried to Patir had various functions, one of which was a high power asteroid scanner. The asteroid in particular was shown to be extremely rich in a particular metal, iridium. There is more iridium on it than on half a dozen Ember Waste systems, planets included, so the asteroid mining theory was starting to become more and more concrete: however, here's the odd part: the concentration of iridium on the asteroid when you jumped away wasn't lower than when the scanning begun, it was higher! For whatever reason, the Fetri'sei aren't extracting the iridium away of the asteroid, they are depositing it there."`

But, soon after passing the terminator, you see near the horizon an extremely reflective material, likely to be some sort of metal. As you get closer it becomes clear that this is the storage of iridium that Dusk was talking about: in front of you there is a huge reserve of the reflective metal you can't see the end of, extending for kilometers and kilometers in every direction inside a gigantic hole the Ka'sei dug in the terrain. The metal appears to be magnetic, as when you start passing over it some of the instruments aboard your spaceship go haywire; luckily, Dusk's scanners remain unaffected allowing you to continue the exploration.`

I've only seen a small number of Builder buildings, but this looks different from anything I have seen.

I presume Taely already told you about the troubled beginnings we had in exploring the area; as a consequence of that, we had to reevaluate the procedures for exploring the nearby systems and species, especially beyond the Ossipago wormhole. Every scout ship entering the area has to always remain cloaked to prevent attacks from the countless Ka'het patrolling the area; this means that the further we need to travel to reach the destination, the more fuel we have to spend to return home which impacts considerably the time we can spend cloaked in the destination. Some of the systems at the other end of the Graveyard have seen very few Starlings, most of them staying for less than a day.`
			`	"Still, even with these limitations we were able to make considerable progress.

There's a lot of compromises we need to take, but luckily we are able to make considerable progress even with these restrictions.`

			`	"I need to prepare a few more instruments before we land," Dusk says as he stops staring at the dome and returns to his equipment.

Given that there is no atmosphere outside you and Dusk wear the extravehicular suits and start walking towards the cupola. He stops in front of one ring and starts looking for some piece of equipment.`

				`	"What is that?"`
			`	"Well, I can't be sure obviously, but given its location and that on the other side there is a pressurized area it should be an airlock. I have seen scans of the Builder stations, and they look quite similar." He takes a heavy-looking scanner, puts it on the wall of the structure and starts moving it around. "If I'm right, this way I should be able find a control station hidden inside the wall - and here it is!" he sings with satisfaction.`
			`	Using a small instrument similar in appearance to a crowbar, Dusk slowly extracts the section from the wall, kicking off a good amount of dust in the process. The control station reveals to be a two sided panel, full of switches and buttons with small alien markings above each of them.`

Soon after the door in front of you opens, revealing a small room with another door at the opposite end. You follow Dusk inside, where he takes out the scanner again to look for another control panel. Once that is open, another switch allows him to close the door. If it weren't for the lights installed in your helmet, it would now be completely dark. Looking around, you notice that the architecture is distinctly alien, with rounded angles on every side of the room and slides going down of both doors. The ring itself is too small for you to pass through it standing upright, but thanks to the low gravity of the asteroid you could almost fly though it without much trouble. "We now have to wait for the room to pressurize," he tells you.`

It should save us some time to do it here, as well as also safer."`
				goto scan

			`	Dusk gives you an odd look. "Of course not <first>, it would almost certainly kill you. Such an alien atmosphere is unlikely to be breathable for a human, and even if it was we couldn't be sure until we analyze it extensively. About that," he says as he begins to activate for another scanner, "I can start analyzing the atmosphere that is starting to fill this room. It should save us some time to do it here, as well as also safer."`

			`	Dusk goes on working on the atmospheric analyzer for about five minutes without nothing happening. You try to connect to the scanner on your ship to check the position of the nearby Fetri'sei, but you the dome seems to jam all the communications with the outside. Suddenly, you hear a loud "pop" and the door that leads inside the dome recesses of a few centimeters. "Just in time," Dusk says, "I've finished analyzing the atmosphere right now. Let's go take a look inside." After a brief look at the writing on the door, he takes a handle on it and slides it to the left. The hatch starts to slowly open towards the interior of the dome. When you come closer to the entrance you are instantly blinded by a strong light coming from the other side of the door. After lowering the sun shield on your helmet your eyes start adapting to the new light level, and it takes you a few seconds to realize what is now in front of you: landed inside the cupola, right in front of the airlock, a Fetri'sei is pointing in the direction of you and Dusk.`
			`	Both you and Dusk stand still in front of it without saying a word. He looks terrified. All of a sudden, the Ka'sei starts emitting a very high pitched sound, very hard to hear, frequently changing in intensity. This lasts only for a few seconds, then abruptly stops.`

Both of you touchdown after a few meters, crashing hard in the terrain that surrounds the cupola. Out of the corner of your eye you see that there's still air coming out of the airlock, meaning that the Ka'sei breached the door soon after you were dragged out.`
			`	Looking around, you see Dusk laying face down next to you. Thinking the worst you start going towards him, but thankfully he begins to stand up before you get there. When he sees you he looks relieved, but his expression becomes much more worried a second later. "We need to run.

The first shot barely misses you; Both you and Dusk jump back to the airlock as fast as possible, but you are too far to reach it before a Ravager shoots again and hits you in the torso, throwing you on the floor.
